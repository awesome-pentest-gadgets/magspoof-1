Magspoof
========
This project is a merged clone of samyk's (magspoof) [https://github.com/samyk/magspoof] and joshlf's (magspoof) [https://github.com/joshlf/magspoof].
Samy has written a very detailed blog and recorded a brilliant video on YouTube.  I would like to copy what they did but couldn't find ATtiny85.  Hence, I tried to port the programmes on Arduino Nano.

The circuit is copied from Samy.  L293D works at 5V, so there's no problem using a USB powerbank for demonstration.


Known Issues
============
1. Track 1 needs a better coil.  If you can send Track 2 but not Track 1, try to improve it.
1. I can't send characters.  I will update the code once I solve it.
